The Following are the results for samples on the validation data:


1)After testing on 1000 validationn images. This was the new_data_model.h5.
True Positive: 457, TN 75, FP 393, FN 75.
Taking the mean of prediction values and comparing that to the mean of the label values. 
 Accuracy, (TP + TN)/(TP + TN + FP + FN), for dataset datasets/90Day-part1-ffill.h5 was: 0.532, Percent of stocks that went up: 0.532, percent of stocks that went down 0.468. TP: 457, TN: 75, FP:393, FN: 75.


2) After further training on the new_data_model.h5, these were the results.
True Positive: 497, TN 51, FP 423, FN 29.
Taking the mean of prediction values and comparing that to the mean of the label values. 
Accuracy, (TP + TN)/(TP + TN + FP + FN), for dataset datasets/90Day-part1-ffill.h5 was: 0.548, Percent of stocks that went up: 0.526, percent of stocks that went down 0.474. TP: 497, TN: 51, FP:423, FN: 29. 

3) Further new_data_model.h5 training with mae. True Positive: 404, TN 129, FP 332, FN 135.
Taking the mean of prediction values and comparing that to the mean of the label values. 
 Accuracy, (TP + TN)/(TP + TN + FP + FN), for dataset datasets/90Day-part1-ffill.h5 was: 0.533, Percent of stocks that went up: 0.539, percent of stocks that went down 0.461. TP: 404, TN: 129, FP:332, FN: 135.
